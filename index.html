<h3> About Me <h3>
  <p> Hi I'm marquasia, I go by Mar, and Asia. NOTHING ELSE! No exceptions. I have no pets, but I have two sisters and they drive me crazy enough! I was born in Rochester NY one week before Christmas. All of my mother's children are 7 years apart exactly and I am the oldest of 4 siblings ( 2 on my dads side, and 2 on my moms).</p>
    <p> I love to cook and to read. My Favorite book of all time is Eleanor and Park </p>
        <img src="eleanor.jpg" alt="Eleanor and Park">

<p> I like to swim because its very calming and I can just focus on swimming, not everything else. My favorite TV shows are Toddlers and Tiaras and jeopardy. One fun fact about me is that I was blind in one eye for four years then I couldn't hear out of one ear for two more.</p>
